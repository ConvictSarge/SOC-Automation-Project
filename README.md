After hours and hours of trying to get thehive setup properly, I cannot get it out of a 'fail' state. I will start over from square one, and make all systems in Azure.

There will be screen shot updates to this guided project. Breif summary, I got everything working but 'thehive' box. I got cassandra to work with a java 8 update. Elastic search needed extra lines of code in the cong file to get working properly. TheHive was not functioning regardless of what I tried, to the point I redid the box from scratch 6 times, in AWS, Azure, VMware, Proxmox, and on an old computer. I could not get it to work with the walk through setting guide.
